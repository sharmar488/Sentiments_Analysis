ReadMe:
1. You need to have both training and test data file on the same directory from where you are running jupyter, both named "train_file" and "test1".
2. I am attaching test file because i converted it to csv format prior reading, rest training file you can use the same.
3. The labels which my source code generating would be automatically saved in the same directory within a file named "output".
